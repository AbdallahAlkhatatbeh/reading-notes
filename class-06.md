## Object 

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

### creating an object : literal notation

To access a property of this
object, the object name is
followed by a dot (the period
symbol) and the name of the
property that you want.

If the method needs parameters,
you can supply them in the
parentheses (just like you can
pass arguments to a funct ion).

### The Document Object Model (DOM)

The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules.
It is implemented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas:

- MAKING A MODEL OF THE HTML PAGE 
- ACCESSING AND CHANGING THE HTML PAGE

##### THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE

- ACCESS THE ELEMENTS
- WORK WITH THOSE ELEMENTS

### summary

The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.

DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.

Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadel i st.

From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent and
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.

An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.

In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .

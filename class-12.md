## Basic usage of canvas 

Let's start this tutorial by looking at the <canvas> HTML element itself. At the end of this page, you will know how to set up a canvas 2D context and have drawn a first example in your browser. 

- The <canvas> element
<canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas> 

At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.

### Drawing shapes with canvas 

Now that we have set up our canvas environment, we can get into the details of how to draw on the canvas. By the end of this article, you will have learned how to draw rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves, providing familiarity with some of the basic shapes. Working with paths is essential when drawing objects onto the canvas and we will see how that can be done.

- The grid
- Drawing rectangles
Unlike SVG, <canvas> only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex shapes.

#### Applying styles and colors

In the chapter about drawing shapes, we used only the default line and fill styles. Here we will explore the canvas options we have at our disposal to make our drawings a little more attractive. You will learn how to add different colors, line styles, gradients, patterns and shadows to your drawings.

#### Drawing text
The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.

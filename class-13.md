### THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS

- DIVING IN

Persistent local storage is one of the areas where native client applications have held an advantage over web applications. For native applications, the operating system typically provides an abstraction layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data like preferences or runtime state. These values may be stored in the registry, INI files, XML files, or some other place according to platform convention. If your native client application needs local storage beyond key/value pairs, you can embed your own database, invent your own file format, or any number of other solutions.

What we really want is

a lot of storage space
on the client
that persists beyond a page refresh
and isn’t transmitted to the server

#### A BRIEF HISTORY OF LOCAL STORAGE HACKS BEFORE HTML5

In the beginning, there was only Internet Explorer. Or at least, that’s what Microsoft wanted the world to think. To that end, as part of the First Great Browser Wars, Microsoft invented a great many things and included them in their browser-to-end-all-browser-wars, Internet Explorer. One of these things was called DHTML Behaviors, and one of these behaviors was called userData. 


### INTRODUCING HTML5 STORAGE

So what is HTML5 Storage? Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.


Which browsers? Well, the latest version of pretty much every browser supports HTML5 Storage… even Internet Explorer!

HTML5 STORAGE SUPPORT
IE	FIREFOX	SAFARI	CHROME	OPERA	IPHONE	ANDROID
8.0+	3.5+	4.0+	4.0+	10.5+	2.0+	2.0+


### USING HTML5 STORAGE

HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.

interface Storage {
  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);
  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);
};


- TRACKING CHANGES TO THE HTML5 STORAGE AREA

If you want to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event. The storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() is called and actually changes something. For example, if you set an item to its existing value or call clear() when there are no named keys, the storage event will not fire, because nothing actually changed in the storage area.




STORAGEEVENT OBJECT
PROPERTY	TYPE	DESCRIPTION
key	      string	the named key that was added, removed, or modified
oldValue	any  	the previous value (now overwritten), or null if a new item was added
newValue	any   	the new value, or null if an item was removed
url*	 string	    the page which called a method that triggered this change

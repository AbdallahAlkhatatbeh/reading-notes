## INTRODUCTION



# create webpages with Html 



### the Structure :
1. header ...> the title of tab for html pages , and it don't show in page .
2. title ...> show up in the browser .

3. body ...> 
4. section 
5. article 
6. main 
7. footer 

u get to building the page and the first step to that is preparing the HTML strucre 
a newibe would go for the good old (<head> <body> <footer>) and fill it out with the elements and the tags
but were training to be pros here so we have to go an extra step
we should devide the page in a more clean matter 
since the <body> is what the user sees it so most of the deviding will be deviding the body into <header> <main> <footer> 
this way its easier to navigate the code for us after a while and for other programmers who will open our code later



HOW HTML, CSS,
& JAVASCRIPT FIT
TOGETHER  ??? 

- <html>
CONTENT LAYER
. html files 

- {css}
PRESENTATION LAYER
. css files 

- j avascri pt()
BEHAVIOR LAYER
.js files 


#### DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.


#### The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.


##### The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

#### Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.








# Programming with JavaScript

How javascript makes web pages ? 

- ACCESS CONTENT 
- MODIFY CONTENT 
- PROGRAM RULES 
- REACT TO EVENTS 



Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in
the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:

## Access the content of the page
## Modify the content of the page
## Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
## React to events triggered by the user or browser 

## the Abc of programming : 

A B C : 
What is a script and how do I create one?
 How do computers fit in with  the world around them?
 How do I write a script for a web page? 


### A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS


A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.
You could compare scripts to any of the following: 
- RECIPES 
- HANDBOOKS 
- MANUALS 

## WRITING A SCRIPT 
## DEFINING A GOAL & DESIGNING THE SCRIPT

To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 


### EXPRESSIONS 

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 


1
EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE 

2
EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE 

var color = 'beige'; 

var area = 3 * 2; 

## OPERATORS
- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
- COMPARISON OPERATORS 

### ARITHMETI C OPERATORS 

NAME  OPERATOR  PURPOSE & NOTES 
ex :
ADDITION  +   Adds one value to another 

 ## STRING OPERATOR 
 There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 


MIXING NUMBERS AND STRINGS TOGETHER 

##  WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

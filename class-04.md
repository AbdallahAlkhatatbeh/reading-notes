## Links 

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Summary LINKS
 Links are created using the <a> element.
 The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
 If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
 You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
 You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

## Layout


#### Building Blocks 

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

- Inline elements

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

These statements update the
message at the top of the page.
The function acts like a store; it
holds the statements that are
contained in the curly braces
until you are ready to use them.
Those statements are not run
until the function is called. The
function is only ca lled on the last
line of this script.

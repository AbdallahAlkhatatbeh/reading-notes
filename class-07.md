## Tables

A table represents information in a grid format.

### <table>
The <table> element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.

- <tr>
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening <tr> tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)


- <td>
Each cell of a table is
represented using a <td>
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing </td> tag.

- <th>
The <th> element is used just
like the <td> element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table
heading.)

You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

XX For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,
<tbody>, and <tfoot>.


### Functions, Methods, and Objects

Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.

Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.

An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.

In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.

Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.

JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).

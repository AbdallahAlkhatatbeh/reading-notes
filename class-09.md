# Forms

### Form Controls 
- ADDING TEXT:
- Ma king Choice s:
- Submitting Forms:
- Uploadid ng Files:

A form may have several form controls, each
gathering different information. The server
needs to know which piece of inputted data
corresponds with which form element.


### Form Structure
<form>
Form controls live inside a
<form> element. This element
should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a
method and id attribute too.

### Summary
FORMS

Whenever you want to c XX ollect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
<form> element.

 Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

 Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.

 HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.


## Lists, Tables and Forms

### Su mmary
LISTS , TAB LES AND FORMS

In addition to the CSS p roperties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

 List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.

 Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.

 Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.

 Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.



## Events

Events are the browser's way of indicating when
something has happened (such as when a page has
finished loading or a button has been clicked).

Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon.

When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.

You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.

The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.

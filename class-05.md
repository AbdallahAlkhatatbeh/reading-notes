The <img> element is used to add images to a
web page. 

You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.

## Understanding Color

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

Understanding Color
Computer monitors are made
up of thousands of tiny squares
called pixels (if you look very
closely at your monitor you
should be able to see them).
When the screen is not turned
on, it's black because it's not
emitting any light. When it's
on, each pixel can be a different
color, creating a picture.


The color of every pixel on the
screen is expressed in terms of
a mix of red, green, and blue â€”
just like on a television screen
